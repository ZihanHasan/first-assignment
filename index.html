                <p>1.7 million people around the world experience homelessness every year. They are living on the
                    streets in major cities, small towns, and in most suburbs. We are working to end the cycle of
                    homelessness. Our programs empower youth and help end the cycle of homelessness.</p>

                <p>Orphans do not have the same opportunities as normal children. They are often forced into child
                    labour to earn money. Given the opportunity of going back to school, these orphans could develop
                    practical skills, which would enable their communities to break out of the cycle of poverty.</p>
